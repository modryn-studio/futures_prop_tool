## TECH STACK DECISIONS

### Why Mailerlite (not ConvertKit)
- ✅ Free automation builder (Kit locks behind paywall)
- ✅ 1,000 subscribers free forever
- ✅ Custom fields for personalization
- ✅ Bearer token API (cleaner than Kit)

### Why No Supabase (Yet)
- Mailerlite stores all quiz data via custom fields
- CSV export available anytime
- Only need database when Mailerlite UI becomes limiting (5K+ subscribers)
- Don't build Month 3 infrastructure on Day 1

### Why 9 Questions (Not 11)
- Removed Q4 (platform preference) — Not critical for initial match
- Removed Q7 (location) — All firms are global
- 9 questions = <2 min completion (better for mobile)
