### Day 1 Build Spec

| Component | Tool | Time |
|-----------|------|------|
| Landing page | Carrd ($19/yr) or single Next.js page | 2 hrs |
| Quiz logic | Typeform, Outgrow, or custom React | 3-4 hrs |
| Email capture | ConvertKit or Beehiiv (free tier) | 1 hr |
| Results page | Static page with conditional logic | 2 hrs |
| Affiliate links | Direct links, no fancy tracking yet | 30 min |
| Analytics | Google Analytics 4 (free, has funnels) | 30 min |

**Total: 8-10 hours = Day 1 done**

---

### Day 2: Distribution (Free Traffic)

| Channel | Action | Expected |
|---------|--------|----------|
| Reddit | Post quiz to r/FuturesTrading, r/Daytrading as "I built this, feedback?" | 50-200 clicks |
| Twitter/X | Thread: "I analyzed 12 futures prop firms. Here's what I found..." + quiz link | 20-100 clicks |
| Discord | Join 3 trading Discords, be helpful, drop quiz when relevant | 20-50 clicks |
| Facebook Groups | Futures/prop trading groups, same approach | 20-50 clicks |

**Goal: 100-300 quiz completions in 48 hours = real data**

---

### Day 3-4: Iterate Based on Data

What you'll learn from Day 2:
- Which quiz answers are most common (tells you who your audience is)
- Which firms get clicked most (tells you where to focus affiliate energy)
- Email open rates (tells you if your positioning resonates)
- Drop-off points (tells you where the funnel leaks)

**Then you decide:** Double down on what's working, cut what isn't.

### Day 5-7: Expand What Converts

If quiz → email → affiliate click is working:
- Add calculator tool (reinforces conversion)
- Build 3 firm pages (only for firms people are clicking)
- Create 1-2 VS comparison pages (only for matchups people are asking about)

If it's NOT working:
- You haven't wasted 7 days building 12 pages nobody wants
- You pivot positioning, offer, or audience
