## PART 2: QUIZ (10 Questions)

### Question 1: Experience Level
**How long have you been actively trading futures?**

- [ ] Less than 6 months (still learning)
- [ ] 6-12 months (getting consistent)
- [ ] 1-3 years (profitable but want more capital)
- [ ] 3+ years (experienced, ready to scale)

*Why we ask: Some firms have steep learning curves. We'll match you with the right difficulty level.*

---

### Question 2: Current Situation
**Have you attempted a prop firm evaluation before?**

- [ ] No, this would be my first
- [ ] Yes, but I haven't passed one yet
- [ ] Yes, I've passed before but the firm didn't work out
- [ ] Yes, I'm currently funded and looking for additional accounts

*Why we ask: First-timers need different features than experienced prop traders.*

---

### Question 3: Budget
**What's your monthly budget for prop firm challenge fees?**

- [ ] Under $100/month
- [ ] $100-200/month
- [ ] $200-400/month
- [ ] $400+/month

*Why we ask: Challenge fees vary from $49 to $600+/month. No point recommending something outside your budget.*

---

### Question 3a: Payment Preference
**Would you rather pay monthly or a one-time fee?**

- [ ] Monthly subscription (lower upfront cost, pay until you pass)
- [ ] One-time fee (higher upfront, but no recurring charges)
- [ ] No preference — whichever firm fits best

*Why we ask: Some firms like Bulenox and Goat Funded offer one-time fees ($85-$535 total). Others charge monthly until you pass. This significantly affects total cost.*

---

### Question 4: Account Size Goal
**What funded account size are you targeting?**

- [ ] $25K-$50K (starting small, proving myself)
- [ ] $50K-$100K (solid capital to work with)
- [ ] $100K-$150K (serious trading capital)
- [ ] $150K+ or multiple accounts (scaling up)

*Why we ask: Not all firms offer larger accounts. Some cap at $150K, others go to $300K+.*

---

### Question 5: Trading Style - Timeframe
**How would you describe your typical trade duration?**

- [ ] Scalping (seconds to minutes)
- [ ] Day trading (minutes to hours, flat by close)
- [ ] Swing trading (holding overnight or multiple days)
- [ ] Mixed (depends on the setup)

*Why we ask: Overnight holding is banned at most firms. If you swing trade, we need to filter carefully.*

---

### Question 6: Biggest Rule Concern
**What's your biggest concern about prop firm rules?**

- [ ] Drawdown limits (I need room for my trades to breathe)
- [ ] Consistency rules (I have big win days followed by smaller days)
- [ ] Overnight restrictions (I hold positions past close)
- [ ] Time pressure (I need unlimited time to pass)
- [ ] Payout restrictions (I want my money fast, no hoops)
- [ ] I'm not sure yet / None of these

*Why we ask: This is the #1 reason traders fail or hate their prop firm. We'll prioritize firms that don't have your pain point — and warn you about firms that do.*

---

### Question 7: Risk Tolerance
**How would you describe your drawdown tolerance during a trading day?**

- [ ] Conservative — I cut losses quickly, rarely down more than 1-2%
- [ ] Moderate — I give trades room, sometimes down 3-4% before recovering
- [ ] Aggressive — I'm comfortable with larger swings if my thesis is right
- [ ] It depends on the trade setup

*Why we ask: Drawdown rules vary significantly. Some firms use intraday trailing (strict), others use end-of-day (forgiving).*

---

### Question 8: Payout Priority
**How important is fast access to your profits?**

- [ ] Critical — I need money out ASAP, ideally daily
- [ ] Important — Weekly or bi-weekly is fine
- [ ] Flexible — Monthly is acceptable if the firm is solid
- [ ] I care more about other factors than payout speed

*Why we ask: Payout policies range from same-day to once-per-month. We'll weight this in your results.*

---

### Question 9: Support & Education
**How much hand-holding do you want from your prop firm?**

- [ ] None — just give me capital and get out of my way
- [ ] Minimal — maybe a Discord community or basic resources
- [ ] Moderate — I'd value coaching, webinars, or structured support
- [ ] Significant — I want mentorship and active help improving

*Why we ask: Some firms are "here's capital, good luck." Others offer coaching, communities, and structured programs.*

---

### Question 10: Dealbreakers
**Which of these would be an absolute dealbreaker for you? (Select all that apply)**

- [ ] Monthly recurring fees (I prefer one-time payment)
- [ ] Consistency rules (I don't want my big wins penalized)
- [ ] No overnight holding (I need to hold positions sometimes)
- [ ] Intraday trailing drawdown (too strict for my style)
- [ ] Activation fees after passing (I already paid for the challenge)
- [ ] Limited platform options (I need TradingView / NinjaTrader / etc.)
- [ ] None of these are dealbreakers

*Why we ask: This is the most important question. One bad rule match = failed challenge or miserable experience.*

## PART 4: EMAIL WELCOME SEQUENCE (5 Emails)

### EMAIL 1: Immediate (Trigger: Quiz completion)

**Subject:** Your prop firm results + one thing most traders miss

**Body:**

Hey [First Name],

Your quiz results are locked in. Quick recap:

**Your #1 Match:** [Firm Name]
**Current Promo:** [Code] for [X]% off

→ [Link to full results page]

Before you buy a challenge, one thing most traders miss:

**The hidden cost isn't the challenge fee — it's the reset fees.**

Average trader takes 2-3 attempts to pass. At $100-200 per reset, that's $300-600 on top of your initial fee.

Your match ([Firm Name]) handles this by: [specific reset policy — free resets on renewal, low reset fees, etc.]

That's why we recommended them for your profile.

Tomorrow I'll send you the specific rules that trip up most traders at [Firm Name] — and how to avoid them.

P.S. If [Firm Name] doesn't feel right, your runner-ups were [Firm 2] and [Firm 3]. [Link to results]

### EMAIL 2: Day 2

**Subject:** The 3 rules that fail most prop firm traders (and how to avoid them)

**Body:**

Hey [First Name],

Yesterday you got matched with [Firm Name]. Before you start, here are the 3 rules that kill most evaluations — regardless of which firm you choose:

1. The Consistency Rule Trap
Most firms limit how much you can make on your best day (usually 30-50% of total profit).

❌ Bad: Make $2K Monday, grind $50/day rest of week = FAIL
✓ Good: Make $400-600/day consistently = PASS

2. The Trailing Drawdown Confusion
"Trailing" means your max loss moves UP as you profit. Most traders don't track this and hit their limit.

[Link to calculator: "Track your trailing drawdown"]

3. The "I'll Pass in 3 Days" Rush
No time limit = no rush. Traders who take 10-15 days pass more often than traders who rush in 3 days.

Your specific rules at [Firm Name]:

Profit target: $[X]
Drawdown: $[X] [trailing/static]
Consistency rule: [Yes/No]
→ [Link to full [Firm Name] rules breakdown]

Tomorrow: Your week 1 game plan.

### EMAIL 3: Day 4

**Subject:** Week 1 game plan for passing [Firm Name]

**Body:**

Hey [First Name],

If you're starting a [Firm Name] challenge, here's your Week 1 blueprint:

**Days 1-2: Feel out the platform**
- Take 1-2 small trades
- Confirm data feeds, execution, platform settings
- Target: Stay flat or small green. Don't dig a hole.

**Days 3-5: Build base profits**
- Target [X]% of profit goal per day
- Stay well within drawdown limits
- Goal: Get 40-50% to target with room to breathe

**Days 6-7: Controlled push**
- Slightly increase size if ahead of pace
- If behind pace: Stay disciplined, don't force it
- Remember: There's no time limit. Slow is fine.

**The math:**
- Profit target: $[X]
- Optimal daily goal: $[X/10] to $[X/7]
- This pace passes the consistency rule AND gives you buffer for bad days

Most traders fail because they try to pass in 3 days. That's gambling, not trading.

### EMAIL 4: Day 6

**Subject:** What to do AFTER you pass (most traders screw this up)

**Body:**

Hey [First Name],

Let's say you pass the evaluation. Congrats — but the game changes.

**3 things that trip up newly funded traders:**

**1. Drawdown rules often get STRICTER**
- [Firm Name] uses [EOD vs intraday] in evaluation
- In funded account, it switches to [X]
- Many traders pass eval, then blow funded account Week 1

**2. Payout rules have hidden requirements**
- You need [X] trading days before first payout
- You must maintain [buffer amount] above drawdown
- Missing this = payout denied

**3. The mental shift is real**
- Evaluation = "just pass, I can reset"
- Funded = "this is my business, I can't blow it"
- Overconfidence post-pass is the #1 killer

**How to handle it:**
- Trade your funded account like you're still in evaluation
- First 2 weeks: Reduce size slightly, bank easy profits
- Once you have buffer + first payout: Return to normal

This email might save your funded account. Screenshot it.

### EMAIL 5: Day 8 (Soft Sell)

**Subject:** Quick question

**Body:**

Hey [First Name],

Quick question — where are you at?

**A)** Started my [Firm Name] challenge — going well
**B)** Started my challenge — struggling with [X]
**C)** Haven't started yet — still deciding
**D)** Went with a different firm

Just reply with A, B, C, or D. 

If you're stuck on anything, I'll point you in the right direction.

— [Your Name]

P.S. If you're still deciding, here's the current promo situation:

- [Firm 1]: [X]% off with code [CODE]
- [Firm 2]: [X]% off with code [CODE]
- [Firm 3]: [X]% off with code [CODE]

These change weekly. I'll keep you posted.
